                Scat the acorn-obsessed saber-toothed squirrel gets revived by the internet gods and on the moment of he comes back he sees an acorn grabs it and try's to open it on the weakened center of Wi-Fi destroying it and then accidently droped the acorn through all of the wifi cables and fibre cables.

                    Day 1 <br>

                    Wi-Fi stopped working all around the planet. When the Wi-Fi stopped working a tenth of the population who was deeply addicted to games and social media couldn't handle hearing that the Wi-Fi had stopped and that all youtubers and twitch streamers couldn't work died in a few hours as they had no chance of living their dreams.

                    Day 2-6 <br>

                    There has been massive job loss with the entire network breaking down many important jobs that have relied on Wi-Fi including teaching causing many schools to shut down and all the people that control the major network pipelines will fall causing them to look for new jobs. All people that work with advertisement have also lost their jobs. The massive drop in economies has caused the whole world to panic with toilet paper running out around the world with many people with no jobs fighting for power with no money. Many fights broke out around the world causing a billion people to die.

                    Week 2 <br>

                    The rest of is slowly dying with one of the main problems being communication with mobile connections compactly busted. Surviving without Wi-fi extremely hard and most would say it is almost impossible. Many families didn't have YouTube or google to learn how to cook a meal and died from eating roar meat and pumpkin. Thousands of people died because they couldn't google how to get something out of their eye or how to get rid of a cold and would die to panic.

                    Week 3 <br>

                    World war three would start as America thought that North Korea had took down their Wi-Fi and North Korea thought that Russia took down their Wi-Fi and Russia thought that America had sabotaged them. This lead to all three countries bombing each other's cities with only people in the outskirts of the countries surviving.
